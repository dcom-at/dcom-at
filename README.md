- 👋 Hi, I’m @dcom-at
- 👀 I’m interested in LOTS of stuff, be it science, music or even how language is related
- 🌱 I’m currently learning lots of stuff, but if i could say just one is  gonna be cybersecurity
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on project that help me understand more the world of programming and its relation with math and physics
- 📫 How to reach me you can send me a message with any proposal to dcom9528@gmail.com (but understand i dont use to log in much)
- 😄 Pronouns: really? call me cat or train!
- ⚡ Fun fact: i like cats and .... trains *the moment i wrote a train get over me* i guess i deserved for not taking pronouns into much account.

- But really, however you feel, just tell me the pronouns you would like to be called, i will use them (the pronoun part as you can see is a tiny bad joke)
- And if you dislike cats you are a daemon, so stop *systemctl stop daemon-hater-cat" lol
